<h1>Education:</h1>

<p>✶High School: I am a senior at Freehold High School in New Jersey as of 2023–2024. Thanks to advice from my vice principal, John Hein, I was able to enroll in the Web Design Program prior to the start of my sophomore year. Web design is just one of the numerous classes I take. Furthermore I'm enrolled in multiple AP and Honors courses.</p>
<p>✶According to the information I found when I initially looked into what makes up Web design, it involves a wide range of disciplines and abilities in the creation and upkeep of websites. The various subfields of web design include search engine optimization, user interface design, web graphic design, authoring (including proprietary software and standardised code), user experience design, and user experience design. I thought it would be fantastic to learn how to structure and organize content on a website for global sharing and accessibility.</p>
<p>✶My Experience: I have been enrolled into the Web Design Program for three years. I have a basic understanding of languages such as (HTML, CSS, JS) and the program has helped me become a better coder.</p>
